# racemod
A 1.7 and 1.8 tournament mod that makes major sources of RNG consistent between different players playing on the same seed. This is the official mod for Spinnaker's Pre1.9 Tournament and Minecraft Relay Cup 2.

- Endermen, blaze, spider, and chicken drop rates are all standardised
- Eye breaks are standardised
- Flint RNG is standardised
- Eyes of ender always point towards the portal room regardless of relogs
- All ravines are removed
- All water and lava pools below y60 are removed (this is different from lava *lakes*, which still occur at y10.
- The rates on a seed can be checked automatically by throwing an end portal frame block with Q
- A tournament world file generated in 1.7 will work as intended in 1.8 and vice-versa.

This mod requires Legacy Fabric 0.12.12+.
