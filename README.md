# racemod
A 1.7 and 1.8 tournament mod that makes major sources of RNG consistent between different players playing on the same seed.

- Endermen pearl drop rates are standardised
- Blaze rod drops are standardised
- Feathers from chickens are standardised
- Eye break rng is standardised
- Eyes of ender always point towards the portal room (1.8 only, couldn't get it to work in 1.7)
- All ravines are removed
- All water and lava lakes below y60 are removed

You need legacy fabric to use this so yeah
